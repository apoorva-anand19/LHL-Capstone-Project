# NBA Performance Ananlysis

    Ananlysis on NBA game data from last 5 years, to find team performance patterns

# Project Planning

    - The goal was to identify if there was a corelation between wins at home base
        and championship wins.
    - In relation to this, BallDontLie offered me game data, active player data and team data.
    - In terms of visualization, I wanted to higlight if any patterns could be infered from
        team performances over the past 5 years.   

# Project Setup

    - Sourced data from BallDontLie https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction
    - Used game, active players and team data.
    - Would like to work more in the future using Box stats.
    

# Project Workflow
    
    - Retrieved data using API calls to BallDontLie API.
    - Parsed through the data and flattened the JSON to dataframes.
    - Engineered the dataframe to make additional information columns to help with
        visualization and regression model.
    - Exported the data csv and used them in Tableau to create visualizations.
